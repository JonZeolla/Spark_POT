Spark POT Student Labs in Scala

These are the 3 Jupyter notebooks in DSWB with code converted to Scala.
Only the code has been update.  The markup and comments have NOT been.
Please review thoroughly.

Dan1 is Student Lab 1, Dan2 is Student Lab 2, Dan3 is Student Lab 3

In Lab 2 - Step 6, I had to change the UDF.

In Lab 3 - Uses the older version
           Had trouble getting MSE
           The predictions seem off
