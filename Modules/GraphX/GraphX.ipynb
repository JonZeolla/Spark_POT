    "# Spark GraphX Analysis of US Flight Data\n",
    "\n",
    "GraphX is a component of Spark for graph analytics that takes advantage of Spark's distributed computing framework. GraphX can be used to effectively model and analyze relationships and processes in a wide variety of applications.  GraphX introduces a Graph abstraction to Spark - a directed multigraph with properties attached to each vertex and edge. GraphX supplies a collection of basic operators that take user defined functions and produce new graphs with transformed properties and structure. GraphX also includes graph algorithms to simplify graph analytics tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will demonstrate the capabilities of GraphX to explore and analyze airline data. Airline data is a natural fit for graph analytics. Data in CSV format is readily available on the US Bureau of Transportation (BTS) website (http://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/home). This demo employs US flight data for March 2016. Data required to run this notebook is hosted at https://ibm.box.com/shared/static/rfhew36plv01cixjweq1mrdrpib4fbcx.csv. The data is downloaded within the notebook code itself, so there is no need to manually download the dataset.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrated how to use Apache Spark GraphX to analyze airline data that is readily downloadable from the US Bureau of Transportation website. We specifically explored the Graph abstraction introduced by GraphX and used several of the basic operators to analyze the strucuture and relationships in the data. We saw how GraphX exposes RDD views of the vertices and edges stored within the graph and how GraphX maintains the vertices and edges in optimized data structures, VertrexRDD and EdgeRDD, which provide additional functionality above and beyond standard Spark RDDs. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also employed graph operators to transform the graphs into new graphs with transformed properties and structure. Finally, we worked with a few of the graph algorithms included with GraphX, like PageRank and Triangle Counting, to demonstrate how they simplify analytics tasks. "
